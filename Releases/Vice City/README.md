## Vice City Autosplitter

### How to Use
This script works with LiveSplit. If you don't have LiveSplit, [download it here](https://livesplit.org).

1. [Download the script here](https://github.com/KZFREW/KZ.Autosplitters/blob/master/Releases/Vice%20City/LiveSplit.GTAVC.asl), be sure it saves as an .asl file!
2. Open up LiveSplit, then right click and choose "Edit Layout" from the context menu.
3. Click the plus sign, hover over "control" in the context menu, and select "Scriptable Auto Splitter"
4. Press "Layout Settings" in the Layout Editor window, and click the "Scriptable Auto Splitter" tab.
5. Click "Browse" and find the downloaded file. Once it loads in, you can select what you want to split during the run.

When changing your settings, **be sure all the parent settings are also enabled!** "The Party" won't split unless you've also told the autosplitter to split for "Lawyer" as well as "Missions".

### Split Settings
This script allows you to split for the following:

- All storyline missions, all asset missions, all gang war missions.
- All Sunshine Autos races and export lists.
- All Stadium events, including the ability to split once all three are complete.
- All Chopper Checkpoints, Off-Road Challenges, and RC Top-Fun missions.
- All vehicle missions: paramedic, firefighter, taxi, vigilante, pizza boy.
- All safehouses (and each safehouse individually)
- All collectibles: packages, rampages, stunt jumps, and robberies along with the ability to split for each collectible collected, or just split when all are collected.
- Timing end of any% (disabled by default).

### Default Settings
Here is what you should expect with the default settings:
- Automatically starts the timer when beginning a new game.
- Automatically resets the timer when starting a new game from the pause menu (if the timer was already running).
- Split for all any% missions in the Japanese No SSU route.
- **By default,** the script does NOT split for the end of any% (loss of control after killing Sonny). If you want to enable this, scroll to the bottom of the Scriptable Auto Splitter page and select "Any% Final Split".
