## Sheep Raider Autosplitter

### How to Use
This script works with LiveSplit. If you don't have LiveSplit, [download it here](https://livesplit.org).

1. [Download the script here](https://github.com/KZFREW/KZ.Autosplitters/blob/master/Releases/Sheep%20Raider/LiveSplit.SheepRaider.asl), be sure it saves as an .asl file!
2. Open up LiveSplit, then right click and choose "Edit Layout" from the context menu.
3. Click the plus sign, hover over "control" in the context menu, and select "Scriptable Auto Splitter"
4. Press "Layout Settings" in the Layout Editor window, and click the "Scriptable Auto Splitter" tab.
5. Click "Browse" and find the downloaded file. Once it loads in, you can select what you want to split during the run.

When changing your settings, **be sure all the parent settings are also enabled!** "The Party" won't split unless you've also told the autosplitter to split for "Lawyer" as well as "Missions".

### Split Settings
This script allows you to split for the following:

- All levels (including tutorial, 1 thru 15, B1 & B2)
- Every time clock (when used)
- Entering the Lucky Goal (i.e. end of the game)

### Default Settings
Here is what you should expect with the default settings:
- Automatically starts the timer when beginning a new game.
- Automatically resets the timer when exiting to the language wheel.
- Split for all "main" levels, as well as the tutorial.
- Split for the end of the game.
- **By default,** the script does NOT split for the time clocks or bonus levels. If you want to enable this, tick the appropriate boxes in the Scriptable Auto Splitter page.
